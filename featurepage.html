        <p>As you can see, my favorite team in the NFL is the good ol 
        Pittsburg, Steelers.The Pats and Jags are cheaters. Apart from 
        football, I like to strugle in Fortnite whenever I go and play at 
        my Dad's house. But I would play with some of my Cousins and my 
        step brother most of the time, so I'm not alone and I can watch 
        what they do so I can get better. Also when I'm there I would 
        sometimes go with my stepbrother to the movies or go to the park 
        and play football.</p>
