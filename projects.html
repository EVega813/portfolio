      <span><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/183014103/"target="_blank">This project is called "Doom of the Broom." Some challenges I faced while 
      completing this project include getting the Witch to turn, making the broom shoot out
      the fire balls, and creating the chart to keep score.</a></span>
      
      <span><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/181590211/"target="_blank">This project is untiteld but, it's meant to be a maze game, almost like Pac-Man. 
      Challenges I faced with this project was getting the bugs too turn around when they hit the boarder,as well 
      as making the bat move around.</a></span>
      
      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/e4b443a6fe"target="_blank">This project is meant be a joke page where we had to use pictures to tell a joke.
      I didn't find much trouble with this project but It took a while since I had to go back and
      forth copying and pasteing the images.</a></span>

      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/82dbe5419d"target="_blank">This project is meant to represent a bussines page where I sell shoes and sneakers. 
        I think I only had trouble with uploading the background picture.</a></span>
        
      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/221b69b850"target="_blank">This project is meant to showcase directions on how to make Empanadas, Martha Stewart style. 
      I was going to use my Grandma's recipe, but at the time I had forgoten the recipe she uses.</a></span>
      
      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/21943c6588"target="_blank">The last project is actually this one I'm presenting now. The main issue I had was uploading 
      the background pictures,but Ms.Corrales had helped me out. This is the project that I'm most proud of, and I think the struggle of completing it, 
      was well worth it.</a></span>
